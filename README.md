# Kinematics GUI

This code was part of a semester thesis at ETH Zurich for Ophthorobotics AG and is just an excerpt which might be useful for other users. It was tried to change the code to a generic form.

This ROS package provides a control interface for a robot based on Qt. Joint positions and end-effector positions can be controlled. All values are in mm and degree. This GUI is intended to be used with SerialKinematics_ROS package.

This is a catkin workspace ROS node. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic Kame.

## Functions

- shows the states and ROS logs
- interface for controlling joint states and end-effector position

## Build

`cd catkin_ws`

`catkin build kinematicsgui`

(builds serialkinematics and all dependencies)

## Run package

Start it over .launch file with all the other nodes:

`roslaunch kinematicsgui kinematicsgui.launch`

Just GUI:

`roscore`

`rosrun kinematicsgui kinematicsgui`

## Dependencies

ros_qtc_plugin

qt_build

The following dependencies should be replaced by your own:

kinematics_controller (for topics and services) -> which depends itself on all the other packages

## Hint

For development, Qt Creator ROS pluggin was used. GUI is based on example generated by ros-kinetic-qt-create and ros-kinetic-qt-build.
